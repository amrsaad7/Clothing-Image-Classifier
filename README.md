### Data

The data set provided for this assignment contains pixel information for many 28x28
grayscale images of clothing, Each image is labelled as one of
the 10 different pieces of clothing:
class_labels = [T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle
boot]

The value of a row in the column "label" corresponds to the index of the item in the
class_labels list.

The features are basically pixels, and the target is to predict the label or class of each image.
